# Project Name: NU Result

# Description
  When students of Natonal University want to see their results, they can only see the subject grade. To get Grade Points or CGPA they have to be manually calculated according to their grades. So they need a solution that will automatically calculate their CGPA based on their registration number and examination year. The way they search the official website.
 So I developed an application called NU Result, which automates the process of calculating CGPA for NU students.

# Features
  - Can see CGPA by searching with their credentials
  - Automate the entier process
